        <p>Risk management is the most important aspect of trading. Without it, you are gambling, not trading.</p>
        <h2>The 1% Rule</h2>
        <p>Never risk more than 1% of your total account capital on a single trade. This ensures that even a losing streak won't wipe out your account.</p>
        <h2>Stop-Loss Orders</h2>
        <p>Always use a stop-loss order to automatically exit a trade if the price moves against you. This limits your potential losses.</p>
